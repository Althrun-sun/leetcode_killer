## What are we doing?

### The problem

Preparing for coding interviews can be overwhelming, especially when you have already solved a lot of problems on Leetcode.(I have done over 300-400 problems) When it comes to interview preparation, focusing on the most important 200 problems is more effective, but the official Leetcode website doesn't provide a personalized to-do list based on user's needs.

### The solution

Leetcode Killer is designed to help users, especially the creator, to prepare for coding interviews by providing a personalized experience. This web application mainly includes the following features:

1. Displaying the most frequent problems of various data structures and algorithms with a progress bar to track your progress.
2. Login and registration functionality for recording individual progress, allowing each user to track their progress, not just the creator.
3. Auto-generating Leetcode answers by calling the OpenAI API, enabling users to consult with the "teacher" or debug in real-time. This feature can significantly improve learning efficiency and better prepare users for coding interviews.

## Description of App

Leetcode Killer is a web application that offers a personalized experience to users who are preparing for coding interviews. It helps users to concentrate on the most critical 200 problems by tracking their progress and providing real-time assistance from the "teacher" using OpenAI's API.
